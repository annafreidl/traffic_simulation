# traffic_simulation

##  README.md still in process

The project is a traffic simulation game. It is loosely based on the computer games
the computer games "Transport Tycoon™" from 1994 and "Simutrans" from 1997.
available variant of "Transport Tycoon™" with an open-source license can be found under the
[OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openttd-releases/latest); [Simutrans](https://www.simutrans.com/en/download/), on the other hand, is open source by itself.
In this game, you manage the transportation network (bus, rail and air) in a
Region with several industrial plants.

The simulation runs continuously, the game map is box-based.

## The following is a small insight (in German) into the creation of the dynamic map using two coordinate systems to make the height tool visually visible.
